### Test summary

The following failed tests need to be discussed.

**Manual tests ‘Update Stories’ section test no. 3 & 4**

When the title field is made empty and ‘Update’ is clicked, a validation message should state the title should be filled out, but no message shows up.  I need to overwrite the customized validation, but I didn’t find the way to do that as of August 19th, 2023.  The form doesn’t get submitted without a title, so this will not cause a serious issue.  I will keep working on the issue.

**Manual tests 'Sign in' section test no. 6**

The check box ‘Remember me’ doesn’t function as expected.  If the checkbox is clicked, the password should be automatically filled out the next time the user enters the username, but when the function was tested, the password remained unfilled.  This doesn't cause a serious problem in the app, but I will try to fix the issue in the future.
